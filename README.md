# GlobalConflictRefugees

This is an on-going personal project where I plan to combine different datasets with the UNCHR refugees data, to search for tendencies and explain past and current refugee migrations, study how global conflicts impact migrations and see if climate crisis is already starting to create a migratory crisis.

## Ongoing

-   Exploratory analysis of Poverty index

## TO-DO

-   [ ] Exploratory analysis of UCDP conflict data
-   [ ] Decide whether to scrap/include other confict datasets
-   [ ] Exploratory analysis of Water scarcity
-   [ ] Exploratory analysis of UNCHR dataset

## Done

-   [x] Data search
-   [x] Data download
